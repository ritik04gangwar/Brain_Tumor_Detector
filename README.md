# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for a deep learning-based Brain Tumor Detection model, which classifies MRI images into "Tumor" or "No Tumor."

## Features

- **CNN Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network built with TensorFlow for accurate tumor classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes normalization and resizing of MRI images.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Scripts to train the model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the model on a web interface for real-time MRI analysis.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detector.git
cd brain-tumor-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Results

The model achieves over 90% accuracy on the test set, making it effective for detecting brain tumors from MRI scans.
