# Brain_Tumor_Detector
This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as "Tumor" or "No Tumor." It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts. The project is built with TensorFlow.
